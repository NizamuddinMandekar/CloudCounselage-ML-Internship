Project Title: Placement Status Prediction and Year of Graduation Calculation

Overview:
This project consists of two distinct problem statements, each addressing a unique dataset and objective.

Problem Statement 1: Prediction of Placement Status

Objective:
The goal is to predict the placement status of students based on the provided training data. The task involves developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a student will be placed or not.

Datasets:
1. 01 Train Data: Contains training data with features related to student profiles and their placement status.
2. 02 Test Data: Contains test data with similar features but without placement status, which needs to be predicted.

Problem Statement 2: Calculation of Year of Graduation

Objective:
The aim is to calculate the year of graduation for students based on the available data in the provided dataset.

Dataset:
1. Final Lead Data: Contains data related to students, from which the year of graduation needs to be calculated.

Files and Directories
- 01 Train Data: CSV file containing the training dataset for placement prediction.
- 02 Test Data: CSV file containing the test dataset for placement prediction.
- Final Lead Data: CSV file containing data for the calculation of the year of graduation.

Problem Statement 1: Prediction of Placement Status
Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
   - Perform feature engineering if necessary.

2. Model Development:
   - Split the data into training and validation sets.
   - Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict the placement status.
   - Tune the model using hyperparameter optimization techniques.

3. Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Predict placement status on the test dataset and generate a submission file.

Output:
- A trained machine learning model capable of predicting placement status.
- A CSV file containing predictions for the test dataset.

Problem Statement 2: Calculation of Year of Graduation
Steps:
1. Data Exploration:
   - Explore the data to understand the available features.
   - Identify patterns or features that can be used to calculate the year of graduation.

2. Calculation Logic:
   - Develop a logic or formula to calculate the year of graduation based on the available data.
   - Implement the calculation and validate the results.

3. Output:
   - A new column added to the dataset with the calculated year of graduation.
